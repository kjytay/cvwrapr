\title{Compute the nobs by nlambda matrix of errors}
\usage{
computeRawError(predmat, y, type.measure, family, weights, foldid, grouped)
}
\arguments{
\item{predmat}{nobs by nlambda matrix of predictions. Note that these
should be on the same scale as `y` (unlike in the glmnet package where it
is the linear predictor).}

\item{y}{Response variable.}

\item{type.measure}{Loss function to use for cross-validation. See
`availableTypeMeasures()` for possible values for `type.measure`. Note that
the package does not check if the user-specified measure is appropriate
for the family.}

\item{family}{Model family; used to determine the correct loss function.}

\item{weights}{Observation weights.}

\item{foldid}{Vector of values identifying which fold each observation is
in. Not in use at the moment.}

\item{grouped}{Experimental argument; see `kfoldcv()` documentation for
details.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\item{cvraw}{An nobs by nlambda matrix of raw error values.}
\item{weights}{Observation weights.}
\item{N}{A vector of length nlambda representing the number of non-NA
predictions associated with each lambda value.}
\item{type.measure}{Loss function used for CV.}
}
\description{
Computes the nobs by nlambda matrix of errors corresponding to the error
measure provided. Only works for "gaussian" and "poisson" families right
now.
